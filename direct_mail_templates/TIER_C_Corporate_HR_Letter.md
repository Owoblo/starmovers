RE: **Employee Relocation Program — Corporate Moving Partnership**

Dear {{Decision Maker Name}},

**Relocating employees? We make it seamless.**

When {{Company Name}} hires talent from out of town — or transfers employees to a new location — the moving process can make or break their first impression of your organization.
